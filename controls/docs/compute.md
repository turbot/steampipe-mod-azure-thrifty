## Thrifty Compute Benchmark

Thrifty developers eliminate their unused and under-utilized compute instances. This benchmark focuses on finding resources that have not been restarted recently, have old snapshots, have high or low disk IOPS and have large, unused or inactive disks.

### Default Thresholds

- [Disks that are large (> 100 GB)]
- [Long running virtual machines threshold (90 Days)]
- [Snapshot age threshold (90 Days)]
